# odin-recipes
Recipe Project for Odin Foundations
This project will involve creating a basic recipe website.
This will test what I have learned so far in HTML like:
Creating an index, linking to other pages, creating lists, inserting images,
etc.

I'll also be reinforcing what I've learned about using git.
